/**

*
* @param pointer_address
*      The address of the pointer pointing to the memory block to be reallocated.
*      This function changes the size of this memory block to `size` bytes. The
*      contents will be unchanged in the range from the start of the region up
*      to the minimum of the old and the new size.
*      If `pointer_address == NULL`, this function will call `exit()` and print
*      an error message containing the caller function.
*      Unless the value pointed to be `pointer_address` is NULL, it must be a
*      valid pointer returned by an earlier call to a memory (re)allocation
*      function.
*      To make it easier to call this function, the macro function
*      `safe_realloc(pointer, size)` can be used. This macro function takes the
*      address of the pointer, which makes calling it the same as calling
*      `realloc`.
*
* @param size
*      The new size in bytes to for the memory block pointed to by `pointer`.
*      Be aware that size is an unsigned type, passing signed values can lead
*      to conversion errors.
*      If `size == 0`, this function will free the pointer and then call `exit()`
*      and print an error message indicating which function requested zero
*      memory. You should set your pointer to NULL yourself explicitly if you
*      want a pointer without memory allocation.
*      If the new size is larger than the old size, the added memory will
*      _not_ be initialized.
*
* @param calling_function
*      The name of the function calling this function. You can pass a
*      custom NULL termination string, or pass the __FUNCTION__ define. You
*      can use the macro function `safe_malloc(size)`, which will automatically
*      pass the __FUNCTION__ define as second parameter. This usage is the most
*      convenient because calling it will be the same as `realloc`.

* @return
*      The return value will be a pointer to the reallocated memory.
*      If the new size is larger than the old size, the added memory will _not_
*      be initialized.
*      If the memory block was moved, this pointer points to the new block and
*      the previous pointer is freed and set to NULL. Otherwise this pointer
*      is the same pointer as before.
*      If for some reason the memory couldn't be reallocated, this function will
*      call `exit()` and print an error message indicating the caller function
*      and the amount of memory requested.
